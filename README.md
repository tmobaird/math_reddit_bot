# math_reddit_bot
This bot acts almost like a simple calculator. To use this bot the indicator word math must first be used. 
The word math is then followed by the operator you would like to use ("add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide").
The operator is followed by the numbers the operator will be acting upon.

Example input and output:

input: math add 2 3
bot response: your answer is 5

Example 2:

input: math multiply 2 2 2 2
bot response: your answer is 16
